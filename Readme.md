## Usage

This module is visible in the BackOffice Customer Edit.

Use the first tab to create, edit or remove families. You can also define default family, use to show specific price to unlogged customers.

The second tab allows you to define how prices are calculated for each family, depending on the products purchase price.

Product's prices are automatically changed in the 'product' loop, you don't need to use 'customer_family_pse_calculated_prices' loop (see below) to get product's prices.
